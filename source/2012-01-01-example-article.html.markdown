#Mixing 3-D printers and mass-produced products.

Thanks to advances in technology and drops in price, it’s become possible to
imagine a 3-D printer in every home. What’s less clear is what we’ll do with
these wondrous machines. It’ll be decades, if ever, before we can print a pair
of Nikes. Luckily, Japanese design studio Takt Project predicts a future where
mass-produced products and 3-D printed parts can be mashed up to create wild
new wares.

>The next step for Takt is creating a web-based platform filled with products
>from multiple brands.

To illustrate this concept they’ve used Muji’s muted home goods as building
blocks for new, and occasionally bizarre, products by combining them with a few
pieces of 3-D printed plastic. Some of these mods are minor—a set of legs makes
previously unstackable storage containers a modular system. On the more extreme
side, ensconcing a nearly platonic Muji alarm clock into a piece of orange
plastic with a suction cup on one end turns a refined timepiece into a gadget
that looks like something from the zaniest corner of the Akihabara. “With this
unique leg, a simple and tasteless Muji clock has turned out to be an
anthropomorphized and humorous product,” says Satoshi Yoshiizumi, one of Takt
Project’s principles.

###Cool Product Hacks Some of the mods feel like magic tricks. A humble frosted
plastic pencil case becomes a hanging pendant lamp when inverted and paired
with a 3-D printed lightbulb holder. A T-shaped clip allows chairs to become
the legs of a table. Not every design is practical, but they’re consistently
clever and help capture the possibilities of this kind of systemic thinking.

Many of the items in this system seem conceptual, but a series of customizable
decorative grates for a Bluetooth speaker could be the collection’s killer app.
A generation ago, young music fans would create mix tapes to embody their
musical sensibilities, soon they might create new skins for their sound
systems. Not everyone can be expected to become a designer, but low-cost tools
and supportive design software could substantially broaden the definition of
interior decoration.
